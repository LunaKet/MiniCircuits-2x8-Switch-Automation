## Matlab
The first step is to make sure that you have the "Instrument Control" toolbox. Like all matlab toolboxes, its pricey, so hopefully you already have it or your school/company can get it for you. A student license would also be pretty doable.  

Once that's installed, download the .NET dll from the mini circuits website. As of today it's https://www.minicircuits.com/softwaredownload/ztvx.html. For your 64-bit computer, place MCL_ZTVX_64.dll in /windows/sysWOW64.  

Next you can start setting it up in matlab.
